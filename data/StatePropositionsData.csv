51,School bonds initiative,"Authorizes $9 billion in general obligation bonds for construction of new facilities at K-12 schools and community colleges. This is the first time school bonds have been placed on the ballot as an initiative after Gov. Brown threatened to veto the Legislature’s plan for a school bond. Brown is the main opponent, arguing the bond is a boondoggle for developers and the construction industry and that the money could be better spent if targeted for low-income communities"
52,"State Fees on Hospitals, MediCal Hospital Reimbursement initiative","Would require the entire $3 billion private hospitals pay to the state to be used for MediCal matching funds reimbursement to hospitals or for children’s health programs. State now takes about $600K for the general fund. Also would require a two-thirds vote to boost the fee on hospitals. This will be a pricy one, with hospitals already putting up nearly $60 million for the campaign and hospital employee unions already in for $3 million"
53,Revenue Bonds,"Statewide Voter Approval initiative: Requires two-thirds voter approval for projects that cost more than $2 billion funded by revenue bonds. This is aimed directly at the governor’s plan for building (and paying for) a new water system to move water through and around the Delta. All the money for the plan comes from a Stockton businessman. Opposition includes the governor, unions, construction industry and business. Expect the opposition to put out a lot of money to block this."
54,"Legislature Transparency Amendment","Constitutional amendment to bars the Legislature from passing any bill unless it has been in print and on the Internet for at least 72 hours before the vote. Also requires video of all legislative proceedings, except closed sessions, to be posted on the Internet. Allow that video to be used for any legitimate purpose. Legislators, especially Democrats, absolutely hate this bill, which they argue will make it tougher to negotiate and pass agreements when time is running out, such as the end of the session. Which supporters, including wealthy Republican Charles Munger, who’s pushing the bill, says is the idea. It’s a tough bill to argue against, especially when Munger has shown he’s willing to spend millions of his own fortune on ballot measures. Expect quiet opposition arguing that it’s a measure designed for and by Republicans."
55,"Tax Extension to Fund Education and Healthcare","This is the measure to extend the 2012 Prop. 30 tax increases on the wealthiest Californians for another 12 years. It will raise better than $5 billion a year. Teachers are pushing the measure, since most of the cash goes to school district (and possible teacher raises). Democrats will back it, Republicans and tax opponents will hate it and Gov. Brown will be studiedly neutral, saying that while he promised a temporary tax, he will “let the people decide.”"
56,"Cigarette Tax Initiative","Increases the cigarette tax by $2 a pack and boosts taxes for other tobacco products and electronic cigarettes with nicotine. Money will go to health-care programs, smoking prevention, research and other stuff. Tobacco industry will spend millions to defeat it, with Tom Steyer and other enviros putting up their money to support. Loud and expensive race. The tax increase is much higher than other tobacco tax efforts that haven’t passed."
57,"Criminal sentences and Juvenile Court Initiative","Eases parole rules for non-violent offenders. Leaves it up to judges rather than prosecutors to decide whether juveniles 14 and older should be prosecuted as an adult. It’s a law and order issue that should be a fair amount of back and forth, but it’s unlike much money will be spent."
58,"English Language Education","The measure, put on the ballot by Democrats in the Legislature, would repeal most of 1998’s Prop. 227, the “English in Public Schools” initiative, which banned bilingual education in the state and required English immersion programs for students who weren’t fluent in English. Democrats hated it then and they hate it now. Problem is, it passed with 61 percent of the vote in 1998 and there have been few complaints from educators about how the current system is working. Likely to be a very noisy election, but don’t know if either side will be raising much money."
59,"Campaign Finance. Voter Instruction. Overturn Citizens United Act","This is a strictly advisory measure asking voters to call on all state officials to use all their powers, including a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United campaign funding decision. All it requires, though, is for the Secretary of State to “communicate the results of this election to Congress.” The governor is no fan, but let it become law without his signature. Supporters say it puts CA on record, opponents say it only clutters the ballot. Likely a lot of noise, but no real money in the campaign."
60,"Adult films. Condoms Initiative","Requires performers in adult films to wear condoms during filming of sexual intercourse. Producers must get a state health license before the start of filming. Let the jokes begin here."
61,"State Prescription Drug Purchasing Pricing Initiative","Bars state agencies from paying more for prescription drugs that what the VA pays. Includes any program where the state is the “ultimate payer” for the drug, which would include MediCal payments. This is likely to be the most expensive fight on the ballot, with big Pharma raising millions to fight this, since it would set a new standard across the country."
62,"Death Penalty Ban Initiative","Repeals death penalty in California and replaces it with life without parole. Applies retroactively to everyone on Death Row. Unlikely that either side will spend much money, but it’s the ultimate law and order issue and California voters have rejected a death penalty ban in the past. NOTE: Joined with the death penalty procedure initiative, with the only that gets the most votes taking effect."
63,"Firearms and Ammunition Sales Initiative","This is Gavin Newsom’s baby. Bans possession of large capacity magazines, limits ammunition sales and requires ammunition buyers to pass a background check and obtain Department of Justice authorization to buy bullets, among other restrictions. This goes well beyond what any other state requires and the NRA already is screaming. Expect a nasty, high-profile contest, with plenty of money spent on the opposition side."
64,"Marijuana legalization Initiative","Allows possession and sale of marijuana for recreational use and sets up a tax on marijuana and hemp. The marijuana guys will raise money for this, but expect the cops and conservative groups to oppose it, though they’ll likely raise less dough."
65,"Carry-Out Bag Charges Initiative","Requires retail stores that require customers to pay for bags to put the profits from those sales into a special fund for environmental projects. Retailers, who have been making money on the bag sales, won’t be happy, but voters, who generally hate paying for bags, will likely be thrilled to move the money to the enviros."
66,"Death Penalty Procedures Initiative","Changes the rules for state death penalty appeals to make them move more quickly, imposes time limits on appeals and requires any attorney handling appeals to take death penalty cases. This is the conservative response to the proposed death penalty ban that’s also on the ballot. NOTE: Only the measure with the greater number of votes takes effect."
67,"Referendum to Overturn Statewide Ban on Single-Use Plastic Bags","Would overturn SB270, the 2014 state ban on plastic bags. It’s the plastic industry and biz groups vs the enviros and there will be plenty of money spent. NOTE: A ‘YES’ vote upholds and ban and a ‘No’ vote overturns it. And yes, referendum votes can be confusing."
